/*
* You are given the following : A positive number N
    Heights : A list of heights of N persons standing in a queue
    Infronts : A list of numbers corresponding to each person (P) that gives the number of persons who are taller than P
        and standing in front of P
* You need to return list of actual order of personsâ€™s height
* Consider that heights will be unique
Example:
    Input :
        Heights: 5 3 2 6 1 4
        InFronts: 0 1 2 0 3 2
    Output :
        actual order is: 5 3 2 1 6 4
* So, you can see that for the person with height 5, there is no one taller than him who is in front of him,
    and hence Infronts has 0 for him.
* For person with height 3, there is 1 person ( Height : 5 ) in front of him who is taller than him.
* You can do similar inference for other people in the list.
